* About me

I am a passionate and curious Melbourne based developer with a penchant for front-end development. I enjoy creating engaging experiences, coding pixel perfect interfaces and making the web accessible for all. I love solving problems, coding, studying, plain text, music and chocolate.

My skill-set revolves around HTML, CSS (SASS, SCSS), JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, WordPress, WordPress API, Gatsby, ACF, Composer, Yarn, Gulp, Git, React, WHM, cPanel, GA, GTM, Mac OS, Linux, Sketch, Figma, Photoshop, Vim and for everything else, Emacs.
